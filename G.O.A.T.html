        <h3>Many argue that Tom Brady is one of the G.O.A.T's in the NFL.
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Brady has won seven Super Bowls, which is the most by any quarterback.</li>
            <li>Brady leads the league in passing yards, touchdowns, completions, attempts, and quarterback wins.</li>
            <li>Brady played at a high level for a long time, while the average NFL career lasts only a few years.</li>
            <li>Brady is known for his loyalty to teammates, helping teammates, and being a big brother to everyone.</li>
            <li>Brady set the standard for aspiring quarterbacks and never experienced a drop in play.(Meaning just arriving and joining a game without booking a spot in advance)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h1 id="pat">
        Brady has alot to offer to the table on proving why he is the G.O.A.T of the NFL but,
        there is a young player who is rising to take this position.
