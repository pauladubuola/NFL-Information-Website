<h3>
There are many types of helmets that NFL players can wear, as long as they meet the league's guidelines.
But when choosing a helmet, players consider factors like: Fit, Comfort, Durability,
Player position, and the player's medical history.
The NFL also prohibits certain helmets, including:
    <ul>
<li>Discontinued helmets that were worn by less than 1% of players for the past two seasons</li>
<li>Helmets that perform poorly in laboratory testing</li>
<li>Helmets that have been discontinued by the manufacturer</li> 
<li>Helmets that were produced by companies no longer manufacturing football helmets</li>
    </ul>
